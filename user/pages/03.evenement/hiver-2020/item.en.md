## Tree climbing: all you need to know

**Do you want to take a breath of fresh air, do a fun, inexpensive family activity that allows children (and adults!) To let off steam? Tree climbing is the ideal activity for this!**

The tree climbing is mainly associated with the adventure course in the heart of nature, more precisely with the **acrobatic course in height** (PAH). It is an aerial and acrobatic discipline inspired by military backgrounds. Today it is suitable for the general public. This activity is accessible to all; young and old alike can come and have fun!
